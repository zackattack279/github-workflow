# TestProject

## Instructions:
Use this project to test the workflow for completing assignments this semester. I have included a simple Java "HelloWorld" project for you to edit, commit, and push from your local machine. NOTE: These steps are for using git via the command line. Extra credit for anyone that forks this repository and adds workflow steps for any gui (Windows, Mac, or Linux) program they use.

## Workflow (Command Line):
1. Click on project invitation
  * This will create a custom repository for you inside the classroom organization account CSCI-490-MobileAppDevelopment
2. Find your custom repository (either by going to organization account or clicking on link that was emailed to you)
3. Click button that is labeled "Clone or download"
  * Copy either the https or ssh link (I recommend you set up ssh)
4. On the command line, navigate to where you want the project to be located
  * eg. Type: `cd cofc/csci490/projects/`
5. Type: `git clone \<paste your repository link here \>`
6. This will put your project on your local computer. You are ready to start editing/adding files. For practice, any text editor will do. Once you have completed your files:
7. Navigate to the top level of your project. This will be where the README is located.
8. Type: `git status` and ensure you see you have something to add to a commit set.
9. Type: `git add .` to add all files (NOTE you can add each file individually if you desire)
10. Type: `git commit -m "initial commit"`
11. Type: `git push origin master`
12. Check your repository in GitHub to ensure that your push was sucessfull. You can make further edits and repeat steps 8-11 as many times as you want/need. I will be able to grade based on these pushes. I will be able to see your progression easier if you commit and push often. This will also allow me to see how much you got done by the deadline and after should you keep pushing after the deadline.
